<i><h3>Technical data:</h3>

This digital media arts installation materializes the past and present of ESTGM/EsACT's 25 years of existence.

Through interaction with tangible architectural elements of EsACT's current facilities, the installation invites the rekindling of memories and active participation in exploring them.

The sounds you hear are reminiscent of ESPROARTE, long-term companions of this institution, while the deconstructed visual elements aid this experience.
